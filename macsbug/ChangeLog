	* MacsBug_display.c: gcc 4.0 doesn't allow static function
	prototypes in a function body, so I moved the prototypes to
	before the function that used to contain it.
	* MacsBug_plugins.c: Ditto.
	* gdb_plugin_support/gdb_io_redirection.c: Ditto.
	* gdb_plugin_support/gdb_set.c: Ditto.

	* MacsBug_display.c: Read all the registers into unsigned long
	long's (since we now treat ALL the PPC registers as unsigned
	long long, and then only print out the lower 32 bits for now.

	* Makefile: Add OPT to control -O level from command line.
	VERSION set to 1.4.
	* MacsBug.h: Fix typeo in stream dcl in struct DisasmData.
	Declared current_pc_lines.
	* MacsBug_display.c: Define current_pc_lines.
	(disasm_pc): Fix comments, changed Disasm_pc_data struct.
	(display_pc_area): Always do "x/0i 0", use gdb_get_register
	instead of gdb_get_register, use x/Ni for N lines instead
	of doing one at a time, add extra line if no symbol shown.
	(save_stack): Use gdb_get_sp to get $sp and changed call
	to gdb_read_memory.
	(save_all_regs): Use gdb_get_register instead of gdb_get_int.
	(__display_side_bar): Use gdb_get_register instead of
	gdb_get_int, gdb_get_sp to get $sp, change gdb_read_memory
	call.
	* MacsBug_patches.c (fix_pc_area_if_necessary): Use
	gdb_get_register instead of gdb_get_int and fix bug in
	range checking.
	* MacsBug_plugins.c (tf): Change call to gdb_get_register().
	(tv): Ditto.
	* MacsBug_testing.i (testb): Ditto plus some bug fixes.
	* MacsBug_utils.c (format_disasm_line): Remove call to
	gdb_internal_error, moved call to get_screen_size to fix bug
	with max_rows and max_cols being unitialized, bump addr in
	this routine instead of by caller.
	(__disasm): Always do "x/0i 0", use gdb_get_register instead
	of gdb_get_int, use x/Ni for N lines instead of doing one at
	a time.
