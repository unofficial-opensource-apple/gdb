2002-06-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@law.apple.com>

	* config/i386/xm-i386-macosx.h: Remove the definitions for
	HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT, HOST_DOUBLE_FORMAT, and HOST_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT
	(they are in xm-i386.h).

2002-06-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@law.apple.com>

	* i386-tdep.c (i386_skip_prologue): This should take a CORE_ADDR,
	not an int.
	* config/i386/tm-i386.h (i386_skip_prologue): Update prototype.

2002-06-10  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (breakpoint_stop_status): If we threw away the 
        previous expression for the breakpoint condition, rebuild it here. 
        (breakpoint_re_set_one): Discard & null out the parsed expression,
        but don't try to reparse it here, or we will recurse infinitely
        trying to reset the breakpoint if we need to call into the 
        inferior to parse the expression.
        
        * minsyms.c (install_minimal_symbols): when we demangle symbols
        for an objfile, set the minimal_symbols_demangled flag so we
        don't do it all over again in objfile_demangle_msymbols.
        FIXME: in the long run, we should see whether we really need to
        do objfile_demangle_msymbols, since the net version doesn't need
        to...
        
2002-06-07  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (bpstat_do_actions): Notice whether we have run
	any commands, and if so, emit a ui_out "notify" message when
	we are done running them.
	(print_it_typical): add a uiout field to the breakpoint hit
	stopped message saying whether there are any commands associated
	with this stop.
	* ui-out.h: Add notify_begin & notify_end function slots to the
	ui_out_impl structure.  Also declare ui_out_notify_begin & 
	ui_out_notify_end.
	* ui-out.c: Add the default_notify_begin & _end functions to the 
        default impl, and implement the ui_out & uo_out versions.
	Also added a make_cleanup_ui_out_notify_begin_end function,
	for use if you are going to do any work between starting & 
	ending the notify session.
	* cli-out.c: Add NULL's for the cli version of the notify functions.
	
2002-05-31  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* config/powerpc/xm-ppc-macosx.h: Add defines for HOST_*_FORMAT
	for floats, doubles & long doubles.  This will sidestep trying to 
	convert floats from ppc native format to ppc native format, an 
	amusing but pointless exercise...
	* config/i386/xm-i386-macosx.h: ditto.

2002-05-30  Rab Hagy <rhagy@apple.com>

      * varobj.c, varobj.h: added "unsigned" format specification
      * stack.c: added frame pointer to output of a stack frame (for MI only)

2002-05-21  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (create_child): Don't do strncmp to set fake_child, or
	you will get false positives...
	(cplus_make_name_of_child): The logic for doing index -> {"public",
	"private", "protected"} was faulty.

2002-05-16  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@bluegill.localnet>

	* Makefile.in: no longer define free to xfree; all instances of
	free in the sources should now be converted.

	* xm-macosx.h: ditto.

	* Makefile.in: add cached-symfile.{c,o}

	* breakpoint.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* expprint.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* interpreter.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* linespec.c:  convert instances of free to xfree.
	* objc-lang.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* core-macho.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-info.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-info.c: convert instances of asprintf to xasprintf.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-io.c: convert instances of asprintf to xasprintf.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-path.c: define strsave as xstrdup, not savestring.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-path.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* macosx-nat-dyld-process.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* macosx-nat-dyld.c: define strsave as xstrdup, not savestring.
	* macosx-nat-info.c: convert instances of free to xfree.
	* macosx-nat-info.c: convert instances of malloc to xmalloc.
	
	* utils.c (xvasprintf): use xstrdup to malloc the resulting string
	instead of the system malloc, so it can be passed to xfree without
	incident.

	* mi-main.c: add mi_interpreter_exec; add to the interpreter struct
	(so that interpreter-exec can also run MI commands).

	* dbxread.c: disable mapping string tables (mmap_strtabflag) by
	default.

	* defs.h: init_malloc now returns a mmalloc pool, possibly
	different from the one passed in (to support returning a
	mmalloc_check pool based on the pool passed in).

	* doublest.c: define NaN to be 0.0 regardless if it is defined by
	the system, to work around __nan issues on WWDC build.

	* objfiles.c: remove allocate_objfile and all related functions;
	replace with new functions in cached-symfile.c

	* objfiles.c: add new variables	'generate-persistent-symbol-tables'
	and 'use-persistent-symbol-tables'.

	* symfile.c: no longer force HAVE_MMAP to 0.  remove test for
	bfd_supports_mmmap (bfd can simply return error from
	bfd_mmap_file).  add "mapaddr" agrument to add-symbol-file.
	re-enable zeroing of msymbol table hash when creating objfile.
	
	* thread.c: properly cleanup the ui_out when there is an error
	generating the thread list.

	* utils.c (init_mmalloc_default_pool): create a mmalloc pool that
	defaults to system malloc, using mmalloc_malloc_create.
	(init_malloc): create a mmalloc_checked_malloc zone based on the
	mmalloc zone passed in, rather than modifying it in place using th
	mmcheckf interface.

	
2002-05-14  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

	* linespec.c (decode_line_1): don't use gdb_completer_word_break_characters 
	when allow_objc_selectors_flag is false.  This only happens when we are
	resetting breakpoints after shared library loads, so it just causes future-break
	to fail on ObjC symbols.
	
2002-05-03  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

	* objc-lang.c (_initialize_objc_lang): New function, set the 
	lookup_objc_class_p.
	* (should_lookup_objc_class): New function, should we look up 
	objc classes as an ordinary part of symbol lookup?
	* c-exp.y: Use should_lookup_objc_class.

2002-05-01  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* infcmd.c (do_registers_info): Print only things with type INT
	as both int and hex.

	* infcmd.c (do_registers_info): Don't check AltiVec types;
	instead treat all non-INT registers as "info all-regs" only.

2002-04-24  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

      * varobj.c (varobj_in_scope_p): New function, tell whether a variable is
      in scope.
      (c_type_of_child): A pointer type might point to a typedef, so you have
      to also call check_typedef on the target before creating its children.
      * varobj.h: declare varobj_in_scope_p.

2002-04-24  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@bluegill.localnet>

        * linespec.c (decode_line_1): Ignore most word separators when
        scanning for breakpoint expression, to allow for better Obj-C
        method parsing.

2002-04-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* infcmd.c (do_registers_info): Check for AltiVec types when deciding 
	whether to print a register as float or int.

2002-04-19  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (type_changeable): Another place where we want to protect
	against accessing a NULL type structure in the varobj.

2002-04-18  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (varobj_create): Add a real block parameter to varobj_create.
	I was overloading the frame for this case, which is fragile, and broke
	in the latest merge.
	* (c_type_of_child): Call check_typedef on parent->type before using it
	to get the type of the child.
	* varobj.h: mutatis mutandi for varobj_create change.

2002-04-18  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	(This is from Jason Merrill  <jason@redhat.com>):

	* gnu-v3-abi.c (gnuv3_rtti_type): If we get confused, just warn
	and return NULL.

2002-04-15  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (varobj_create): Make it possible to create a
	USE_SELECTED_FRAME varobj when the variable is not currently
	defined, and defer defining it till it shows up.
	(varobj_get_num_children): if we couldn't parse the expression
	yet, return -1 for number of children.
	(free_variable): Don't free the current expression if it is NULL.
	(variable_language): Punt (say it is C) for variables we couldn't
	find yet.
	(value_of_root): varobj_create can now return a non-null varobj,
	with a NULL exp struct.
	
2002-04-08  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* target.h: Add to_bind_function entry to target_ops.
	* target.c: initialize to_bind_function appropriately.
	* valops.c (create_cached_function): Initialize "bound" flag.
	(lookup_cached_function): bind the function before calling.
	* values.h: Add bound field to the cached_value struct.
	
2002-04-05  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* ui_out.c (ui_out_is_mi_like_p): Check for the uiout being NULL.

2002-04-04  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* valarith.c (find_size_for_pointer_math): New function, return
	the size of a pointer's target, or 1 for void *, or error with
	an appropriate message for incomplete types.
	(value_sub, value_add): use find_size_for_pointer_math.

2002-04-04  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (cplus_make_name_of_child, cplus_make_path_expr_of_child):
	Don't skip over the vptr entry, that is already taken care of in
	cplus_real_type_index_for_fake_child_index.

2002-04-03  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* infrun.c (restore_selected_frame): The code here was misusing
	fr->level, which is an absolute frame (coming from selected_frame_level) 
	and not a relative frame level.
	* varobj.c (c_value_of_root): Restore both the selected_frame and
	the selected_frame_level.

2002-04-02  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* symtab.c (make_symbol_completion_list): Don't try to get the
	length of sym_text till after you've made sure it is not NULL.
	(make_symbol_file_completion_list): ditto.

2002-04-01  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* linespec.c (decode_line_1): When handling file:line specs,
	if funfirstline is 1, actually move the breakpoint past the
	prologue.  This is done for functions, and the same rationale
	holds for source line specifications.
	* symtab.c (find_pc_line): fix silly bug - NB, this is already
	fixed on the FSF head, but that code relies on some other changes.

	* varobj.c (varobj_update): If selected_frame is NULL, then
	just don't bother with trying to restore it.

2002-03-29  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* valarith.c (value_sub): If you are doing pointer - integer,
	and TYPE_LENGTH of the pointer's target comes back 0, set it 
	to 1.  This is what value_add does, and we should be consistent.

2002-03-28  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* varobj.c (child_exists): New function.  This is a fast way to
	get the child corresponding to a given index.
	(get_type_deref): Pass out whether the original was a pointer or not.
	(path_expr_of_variable): New function.  This returns the full path
	expression to a variable.  The intent here is that you could use
	this to make a new root varobj corresponding to the child varobj
	whose path expression you are getting.
	(varobj_get_path_expr): New function.  External wrapper for 
	path_expr_of_variable.
	(c_path_expr_of_child, cplus_path_expr_of_child, java_path_expr_of_child):
	New functions, return the path expr of a child in its parent.  Also caches
	the expr for later use.
	(make_name_of_child, c_make_name_of_child,
	cplus_make_name_of_child, java_make_name_of_child):
	"name_of_variable" used to serve both the create name and the
	return name functions.  This was inefficient; since you only need
	to compute the name when you make the variable, you ended up doing a whole
	bunch of work just to do simple lookups.  So I split the two functions, and
	made separate calls for them.  These are the make name calls.
	(name_of_variable): This now just returns the name, it doesn't recompute it.
	(is_root_p): New convenience function, returns whether a variable is a root.
	Then I changed all the uses of var->name to use name_of_variable, and the test
	for is this a root were changed to use is_root_p.

	(varobj_set_value): Remove the baseclass offsetting, since value_cast now
	handles this properly (Keith took this out of the FSF version too).

	* varobj.h: Added def'n of varobj_get_path_expr.
	
2002-03-27  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* config/i386/tm-i386-next.h: Define HAVE_I387_REGS properly so gdb doesn't
	think ALL registers are floating point registers.

2002-03-19  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* defs.h: Add test for gcc 3 to test of whether to use __PRETTY_FUNCTION__.

2002-03-15  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	*c-exp.y: If you have found a variable that is a field of this, don't ALWAYS
	make it hang off "self" check the language first!

2002-03-12  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* cp-abi.c (set_cp_abi_cmd, show_cp_abi_cmd,): New functions, 
	allow you to set & show cplus abi's in case gdb gets it wrong.
	(set_cp_abi_as_auto_default): New function, set the "auto" abi
	to be this abi.
	(is_cp_abi_auto_p): New function, say whether the current abi
	is the default or not.
	(_initialize_cp_abi): Define the cp-abi switching commands.
	* cp-abi.h: declare the new functions.
	* minsyms.c (install_minimal_symbols): don't switch the cp_abi
	unless the current abi is auto.
	* gnu-v2-abi.c (_initialize_gnu_v2_abi): don't switch to gnu-v2,
	but set it as the auto_default instead.	

2002-03-05  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>
	
	* stack.c (print_frame): restore the (local) print_frame_more_info_hook that
	got dropped in one of the merges.

2002-03-05  James Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* target.h: add print_section_info_objfile, it is used in next code.

	* utils.c (error_stream): Don't dump error info to the console for mi-like
	interpreters - it is already added to the command return.

	* valops.c (set_unwind_on_signal): New function, allow C-code to
	set the unwind_on_signal flag.
	* value.h: declare set_unwind_on_signal.

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_cmd_var_evaluate_expression): Add -u flag to unwind on
	signal for inferior function execution.
	
2002-02-21  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* valops.c (find_overload_match): remove some useless code that was removed
	from the FSF version but somehow didn't get expunged in the merge.

	* symtab.c (make_file_symbol_completion_list): remembet to set sym_text
	to the place in the input string where we think the symbol begins.

2002-02-20  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	* event-top.c (gdb_setup_readline): Don't turn on readline event
	handling if instream is NULL (usually when reading script commands)
	since there is no input to wait on anyway...

2002-02-06  Klee Dienes  <klee@apple.com>

	* fork-inferior.c (fork_inferior): Add '!' to the list of
	characters that need to be quoted when building a string for the
	shell.  Quote '!' specifically with a backslash, since CSH chokes
	when trying to evaluate "str!str".

2002-01-29  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	* interpreter.c (gdb_interpreter_ui_out): Add accessor function.
	* interpreter.h: declare it.

2002-01-28  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	* stabsread.c (read_type): Handle the case where there is a type
	def'n WITHIN the argument list for a class method.  Need to step
	over the ";" that terminates the def'n or read_args will lose it.
	* (read_args): If for some reason you find NO types, return an
	error rather than crashing.

2002-01-25  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	Generalize the gdb_event, and allow clients outside of event-loop.c
	to create & queue gdb events.  Also, make sure that the client_data
	that gets passed into fetch_inferior_event makes it down to 
	target_wait, which very well might need it.

	* defs.h: add client_data to target_wait_hook.
	* event-loop.c: export event_handler_func type.
	  generalize the "fd" field of the gdb_event structure - make it
 	  a void *.
	* (gdb_create_event): New internal function, implements the generic
	parts of creating a new event structure.
	* (gdb_queue_event): New function, how clients will create & queue
	a new event.
	* various places - mutatis mutandi for the type changes in the 
	gdb_event structure.
	* event-loop.h: declare gdb_client_data, the event_handler_func
	and gdb_queue_event.
	* infrun.c: Pass NULL (in the non-async case) or the client_data 
	(in the async case) to target wait where appropriate.
	* inftarg.c: add gdb_client_data to child_wait.
	* target.c: add gdb_client_data to debug_to_wait.
	* target.h: fix declaration of to_wait element of the target vector.
	* thread-db.c: add gdb_client_data to thread_db_wait.
	* top.c: fix another call to target_wait_hook.
	* config/nm-nextstep.h: Fix declaration of child_wait.

	* dbxread.c (_initialize_dbxread): Add a flag: read_type_psyms
	to control whether we construct psyms for types.
	* (read_dbx_symtab): Check the flag.

2002-01-15  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* objc-lang.c: Have to include regcache.h or FETCH_ARGUMENT will
	not convert the return value from read_register correctly, and
	will mangle the value.

	* infcmd.c (attach_command): Guard use of SOLIB_ADD with #ifdef.

2002-01-15  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* ui-out.c (ui_out_end): Remove some bits of my patch to the list 
	elements in a table bug that were superceded by Andrew's subsequent
	patch, and caused a crash if left in place.

2002-01-15  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	stabsread.c (read_one_struct_field): gcc 3.1 inserts type def'ns into the
	class stab, and terminates the embedded type def'n with a ";", which gdb is
	not expecting.  Strip it off if it does that.

2001-12-11  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	utils.c (gdb_check_fatal): mutatis mutandi for changes to
	internal error.

2001-12-11  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	These changes are a start at making varobj more robust when
	you get an error generating a type for a varobj you can't
	ignore.  This arises, for instance, if you have an error
	in generating the varobj for a child variable.

	* varobj.c: Add fake_child element to the varobj structure.
	This is better than relying on type == NULL, value == NULL,
	since you can't tell the difference between a fake child and
	an error.
	(varobj_get_type): If we can't get the variable's type, don't 
	continue as you will only crash...
	(create_child): set fake_child appropriately.
	(cplus_number_of_children): If you can't get the type, you can
	count the number of children.  Just return 0.
	(cplus_value_of_child): If gdb_value_struct_elt returned an error,
	don't go on to try c_value_of_child.  It won't work either...
	(cplus_type_of_child): skip over fake child to its parent when
	getting the type.

2001-12-03  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (bpstat_do_actions): Allow an async target
	to run breakpoint commands in an asynchronous fashion.  The 
	code before this was forcing the target to look synchronous
	to get the breakpoint commands to work right.
	(async_breakpoint_command_continuation): New function, the
	continuation for commands that run the inferior in a breakpoint
	command.
	* inf-loop.c (inferior_event_handler): reorder the 
	complete_execution and the continuations to handle breakpoint
	commands that continue the target.
	* cli/cli-script.c (execute_control_command): If we are in 
	the mi, then breakpoint commands should get run under the
	"interpreter execute" command to get the output right.
	
	* breakpoint.c, breakpoint.h (find_finish_breakpoint): Need
	access to the finish breakpoint so we can make the finish - 
	hit solib breakpoint - continue sequence look like finish.
	* infrun.c (handle_inferior_event): store away the current 
	finish breakpoint if we actually stop for a solib event while
	a finish is queued up.
	(normal_stop): print the function-finished result if we have
	hit the ersatz finish breakpoint.

	* symtab.c (find_line_pc_range): Don't error out if you can't 
	find the source file.  It is not needed to get the linetable 
	mapping.
	
2001-12-03  James Ingham <jingham@inghji.apple.com>
	Import from Neutrino tools branch:

	* utils.c (make_my_cleanup): Add a guard for a null cleanup
	function.  I have one bug report that this had happened, but I
	can't get it to repeat.  This will hopefully help catch the bug...
 
       * ui-file.c (fputs_unfiltered): Don't pass null buffers to the
       lower layers of the ui_file code.

       * varobj.c (varobj_create): Remember to release the "type" value
       from the value chain if we make a varobj that we can't resolve
       immediately.  Otherwise we will get a double free.

       * symtab.c (in_prologue): The check for metrowerks_stepping and NO
       metrowerks function range caused unnecessary stops.  Remove it.
 
       * breakpoint.c (print_one_breakpoint): Print the address string of
       an unset future breakpoint.  This was coming up empty before the
       change.
 
       * infrun.c (handle_inferior_event): Handle nexti when in a
       function prologue by ONLY continuing if we are at the beginning
       the prologue.
	
	* gdb/infrun.c, gdb/symtab.c, gdb-next/macosx-metrowerks.c: Add
	support for metrowerks step_func_start & step_func_end
	so we can more easily run under MW with no symbols.
	
2001-11-28  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* inferior.h: restore STARTUP_WITH_SHELL, and add the
        start_with_shell_flag variable to here.
	* infcmd.c: define start_with_shell_flag here, and prime it
	with STARTUP_WITH_SHELL.
	* fork-child.c: remove def'n of start_with_shell_flag from here
	but this is where you can dynamically change it still...

	* ui-out.c (verify_field_alignment): Don't verify the field
	alignment if you are building a table, but not at the table level
	(which is currently fixed at 1.).
	(ui_out_end): If you are building a table, and return to the table
	level you have just finished the current table column, and should

	* symfile.c (init_filename_language_table): Change ".M" and
	".mm" to language_objcplus.
	* c-typeprint.c: Add test for language_objcplus to test for
	language_objc.
	* utils.c: Ditto.
	* symtab.h: Ditto.
	* symtab.c: Ditto.
	* stabsread.c: Ditto.
	* printcmd.c: Ditto.
	* language.c: Ditto.
	* maint.c: Ditto.
	* c-typeprint.c: Ditto.
	* partial-stab.h: Ditto.
	* language.h: Ditto.
	* objc-lang.h: Remove prototypes for objc-parse.y; reformat.
	* objc-lang.c: Add objcplus_language_defn; change parser for
	objc_language_defn to c_parse.
	* eval.c (evaluage_subexp): Remove objc_msgsend_typed; pass
	appropriate values to call_function_by_hand_expecting type
	instead.

2001-10-31 Jason Molenda (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* symtab.c (gdb_mangle_name): Merge didn't pull in FSF changes to
	this function.
	(lookup_partial_symbol): Fix language conditional.
	(make_symbol_overload_list):  Move symbol check from here.
	(make_symbol_completion_list): To here, where it was pre-merge.

	* varobj.c: Comment typo.

2001-10-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * symtab.c (lookup_block_symbol): Remove this wrapper function.
        (lookup_block_symbol_helper):  Rename to lookup_block_symbol() as
        it was originally; remove special handling for ObjC which assumes
        that lookup_block_symbol doesn't work correctly for unmangled
        identifiers (i.e. identifiers with spaces in them).

2001-10-12  Jim Ingham  <jingham@w098.z064220144.sjc-ca.dsl.cnc.net>

       * valarith.c (value_sub): Don't pass a raw type to
       value_from_pointer, it has to go through check_typedef first.

2001-10-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

       * dbxread.c (process_one_symbol): Use complain, not warn, so
       we don't spam users too much.

2001-10-08  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

       * symtab.h (symtab_and_line):  Revert kdienes' patch of 2000-05-22
       and make sal.line a (signed int) again.

2001-10-05  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

       * dbxread.c (process_one_symbol): Ignore function end stabs when
       we are not currently in a function.  Some linkers neglect to clean
       up properly when coalescing functions.

2001-09-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * symtab.c (lookup_block_symbol):  Break out of linear search
        if we're past the range of possible matches.

2001-08-31  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* c-valprint.c (c_val_print):  Second call to check_typedef ()
	is no longer necessary.

2001-08-06  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* symtab.c (in_prologue): If the function start address doesn't
	look like a prologue start, try also scanning from the pc.  This
	helps us in some cases where we have bad debug info so the
	function address is off in never-never land.  I have seen this
	happen in PEF binaries where there are some functions with
	traceback tables inlined, but not all.

2001-08-02  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* varobj.c (cplus_real_type_index_for_fake_child_index): New
	function, return the index in the class type for the n'th child of
	one of the varobj fake children.
	(cplus_name_of_child): Use this function rather than just assume 
	the class writer had ordered her variables in a particular order.

	(c_value_of_variable): Make sure you count the number of children
	before reporting it in an Array's value string.

2001-08-01  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* command.c (_initialize_command): The file name completer is more
	appropriate for "shell" than the default completer...

2001-07-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* valops.c (value_rtti_type): Check for minsym == NULL BEFORE using it.

2001-07-06  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* wrapper.c (gdb_varobj_get_value): provide a save
	varobj_get_value.
        * wrapper.h: declare it.
	* cli-out.c: wrapper.h now requires varobj.h.
	* gdbtypes.c: ditto
	* values.c: ditto
	* varobj.h: ditto
	
2001-06-21  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* varobj.c (cplus_value_of_child): Just cosmetic - I find the
	added brackets more readable.

2001-06-20  Ira L. Ruben  <ira@apple.com>
	* breakpoint.c (parse_breakpoint_sals): Handle case where address
	is NULL and default_breakpoint_valid to set addr_string to "*pc"
	(sal.pc) to avoid warning from breakpoint_re_set_one().

2001-06-15  Ira L. Ruben  <ira@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: Update dependencies for breakpoint.o
	
	* breakpoint.c (set_raw_breakpoint): init new original_type field.
	(create_breakpoints): Handle new original_type argument.
	(break_command_1): Ditto. 
	(do_captured_breakpoint): Pass new original type to create_breakpoints.
	(break_at_finish_at_depth_command_1): pass original type to
	break_command_1.
	(break_at_finish_command_1): Ditto.
	(break_command): Ditto.
	(future_break_command_1): Ditto.
	(tbreak_command): Ditto.
	(hbreak_command): Ditto.
	(thbreak_command): Ditto.
	(stopin_command): Ditto.
	(stopat_command): Ditto.
	(watch_command_1): Handle new original_type argument.
	(watch_command): Pass new original type to watch_command_1.
	(rwatch_command_wrapper): Ditto.
	(awatch_command): Ditto.
	(ignore_command): Suppress newline if from_tty is false.
	(write_one_breakpoint): new routine for save_breakpoints_command.
	(save_breakpoints_command): Add save-breakpoints command.
	(_initialize_breakpoint): Define save-breakpoints and its aliases.
	
	* breakpoint.h (enum bptype): Add new breakpoint types.
	(struct breakpoint): Add field to recore original breakpoint type.
	
	* main.c (captured_main): Initialize $input_radix and $output_radix.
	These are referenced by a save-breakpoints file to preserve radix
	across the breakpoint restoration.
	
	* tracepoint.c (tracepoint_save_command): Fix fopen error reporting to
	show errno information just like save-breakpoints command.
	
	* valprint.c (set_input_radix_1): Set $input_radix.
	(set_output_radix_1): Set $output_radix.

2001-06-15  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infcmd.c (_initialize_infcmd): If the "run" completer is the
	file completer, then the "set args" should be as well.  Make it
	so...

2001-06-13  Jim Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infcmd.c: Make the completer for run be the file completer.  It
	is very common for file names to be the arguments to programs,
	nothing else really makes sense...

	* valops.c (value_cast): When you are consing up the pointer type
	for a superclass, set the enclosing type as well or all the
	superclass fields will be incorrect.

2001-06-08  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (_initialize_breakpoint): Add "break ... if <cond>
	to the documentation for the breakpoint command.

2001-04-17  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* blockframe.c (create_new_frame): move the INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO
	call to BEFORE the find_pc_partial_function.  This ensures that we
	will never get a frame without an extra_info because of an error
	in find_pc_partial_function.

2001-04-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* symtab.c (find_line_pc_range): Check that linetable is not null
	before you dereference it.

	* varobj.c (cplus_value_of_child): check that gdb_value_ind does
	not return null.  In the C++ case, gdb_value_ind tries to look up
	the superclass, and sometimes fails miserable.  Protect against
	that.

2001-03-12  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* valops.c (value_rtti_type): Remove the attempt to offset to 
	the full type, since that never worked for the hard cases were
	it might be useful, and failed for the easy cases...  NB. This
	code is pretty useless for GCC right now.  But at least this
	renders it harmless.

2001-02-13  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* event-top.c (display_gdb_prompt): Call target_terminal_ours
	before we reinsert the readline callback handler.  This is
	necessary if the inferior dies unexpectedly, and the code doesn't
	clean up.

2001-02-12  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infrun.c (proceed): set target_executing to 0.  normal_stop
	doesn't do this, and in the non-asynchronous case,
	complete_execution doesn't get called either.

2001-02-05  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* objc-lang.c: If syms is NULL, don't try to dereference it!

2001-01-25  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infrun.c: Initialize sync_execution to 1 - this is the default
	mode for running gdb...

	* event-top.c (async_enable_stdin): Don't mess with sync_execution
	in this function.  You should not lie about the mode of execution
	just to get the terminal multiplexing to work.  It adds a lot of
	fragility to the code.
        (async_disable_stdin): ditto.
	
	FIXME: These changes reverse some hacks to get the remote target
	to work with async.  The remote hacks are evil & bad, but these
	changes will have to be revised before we can submit the code
	to the FSF.
	
	* cli-out.c (cli_interpreter_resume): Initialize the sync_execution to 1 
	when you resume the cli interpreter.  This is the correct value for the
	cli interpreter.

2001-01-24  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* inflow.c (terminal_ours_1): When you are attaching, don't try to
	get the inferior_process_group from the controlling terminal.
	This is almost never right, and will cause ^C not to work.

2001-01-17  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* varobj.c: Add in_scope field to the root structure.
	(new_root_variable): Initialize in_scope.
	(varobj_update): Better track variables going into &
	out of scope.
	(varobj_create): For non-use_selected_frame variables, always
	check whether the variable is in scope.  Evaluation will often
	return true even when the variable is not in scope, but it is
	bogus...

2001-01-10  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* stack.c (print_frame): Add a call to print_frame_more_info_hook
	so other interpreters than the CLI can add info to the stack
	printing without affecting the CLI output.
	* defs.h: Added def'n of print_frame_more_info_hook.
	* top.c: Added declaration of print_frame_more_info_hook.

2001-01-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* symtab.c (lookup_symbol_aux): Call lookup_symbol_aux to lookup a
	mangled symbol rather than recursing into lookup_symbol, since this
	will just re-unmangle the name & call lookup_symbol_aux - leading to 
	an infinite recursion.

2000-12-18  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (bpstat_do_actions): Force the execution of breakpoint
	commands to be synchronous.  This is a hack to work around the fact
	that asynchronous execution of breakpoint commands doesn't work for
	truely synchronous commands.  The correct fix is for synchronous 
	versions of commands (like "continue" as opposed to "continue&")
	not to return till they have finished execution.  Stay tuned.

	* gdbtypes.c (check_typedef): Make sure check_typedef never creates
	a type structure where the type & the target_type point to the same
	memory.  This was happening when you had a typedef for an incomplete
	type.  This is not the complete fix, since such types should not get
	get created in the first place, but this keeps the error from hanging
	gdb.

2000-12-15  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* varobj.c (varobj_create): Added USE_BLOCK_IN_FRAME which treats
	the "frame" variable as the address of a block structure.  The
	varobj will be bound to that block.  FIXME - need to come up with
	a type-safe interface to this.
	(varobj_get_valid_block): New function, returns the startaddr &
	endaddr for the valid block for a varobj.
	(value_of_root): Check that we are in the local block in which the
	varobj is defined (as opposed to the frame in which it is defined).
	(varobj_pc_in_valid_block_p): New function, returns whether the pc
	in the frame for this varobj is in the block in which this varobj 
	is valid.
	

2000-12-12  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (do_captured_breakpoint): Move test for sals.nelts -
	i.e. "Did we find a breakpoint" AFTER test for "is this a future
	break..."

2000-12-04  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* main.c (captured_main): The coreargs variable has been quoted,
	so it is no longer a number, and fails the "could be a PID" test.  
	Strip the quotes before the test...

	* top.c (execute_user_command): Set the target to synchronous
	during the execution of user defined commands.  Otherwise the 
	command execution will get out of order.

	* target.c (gdb_set_async_override): New function, overrides the 
	target's can_async method when we really need to ensure that a
	command gets run synchronously...

2000-11-22  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* varobj.c (varobj_get_type_struct): New function, return the
	type structure (as opposed to a printed string) for the varobj.

	* event-top.c (_initialize_event_loop): Don't use the
	cli_command_hook if you are not using the event loop.
	(gdb_setup_readline): Don't muck with gdb_stdout & friends if 
	you are not using the event loop.  These ui_out's don't work
	right in that case.  NB The non-event loop version of gdb should
	fade away at some point...
	(gdb_disable_readline): remove the gdb_stdout & gdb_stderr ui_outs
	when you disable readline.

2000-11-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* breakpoint.c (captured_parse_breakpoint_sals): New function, need
	to catch this call in gdb_breakpoint so I can implement future
	break in the mi.
	(do_captured_breakpoint): Add a futureflag, and if it is yes, then
	catch the error, and set a future breakpoint instead.
	* defs.h: Change definition of gdb_breakpoint to match.

2000-11-08  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* interpreter.c: Add an exec_proc to the interpreter structure, so
	you can instruct an interpreter to execute a text string -
	bypassing the UI.
	* cli-out.c (cli_interpreter_exec): New function, implements
	exec'ing a command in a safe way.

	* wrapper.c (safe_execute_command): New function - a catch_errors
	wrapper for execute_command.
	(wrap_execute_command): The wrapped function implementing
	safe_execute_command.
	* interpreter.c: Add the ability to set an interpreter into
	"quiet" mode where it doesn't print a startup notice, and
	supresses prompt printing.
	(gdb_interpreter_set_quiet): Sets the quiet flag
	(gdb_interpreter_is_quiet): Returns whether the interp is quiet or
	not.
	(gdb_set_interpreter): Don't print interpreter switch banner if we
	are quiet.  
	* cli-out.c (cli_interpreter_display_prompt): Use the quiet flag
	in prompt display.

2000-11-07  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infrun.c (handle_inferior_event): Add a separate test to handle the case where you
	are nexti'ing in code with NO symbols.  In this case the old code assumed you were 
	always in a function prologue, test if you are not, and stepi correctly...

2000-11-01  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* interpreter.c: New file, implements switchable interpreters
	for gdb.
	* interpreter.h: Ditto.
	* cli-out.c, cli-out.h: Add the interpreter functions.
	* event-loop.c (start_event_loop): Poll the interpreter's event loop
	as well as gdb...
	* event-top.c (gdb_setup_readline, gdb_disable_readline): New functions,
	used by console & mi to grab & relinquish control of the readline input.
	* main.c (captured_main): strsave the interpreter name, since we will
	eventually use it as a set variable.
	* top.c (gdb_init): Use the interpreter mechanism to startup the stdin 
	handling.
	* mi/mi-cmds.c, mi/mi-cmds.h: Add mi command -interpreter-set.
	* (captured_mi_execute_command): actually return the MI result
	code out of this function.
	* (mi_execute_command): Don't print the prompt if the command return
	is MI_CMD_QUIET.
	* mi/mi-main.c: Add the interpreter functions.
	* mi/mi-main.c (mi_set_interpreter): implements -interpreter-set.
	* mi/mi-main.c (_initialize_mi): This now just registers the mi interpreter.
	
2000-10-19  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* partial-stab.h (switch): Add the N_BNSYM & N_ENSYM stabs to the stabs list.
	* dbxread.c (process_one_symbol): ditto.

2000-09-22  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* infrun.c (handle_inferior_event): Errors in the call to
	breakpoint_re_set will cause async_enable_stdin to get called from
	the exec_error_cleanup.  So we need to disable stdin again before
	proceeding.

2000-09-06  Jim Ingham  <jingham@localhost>

	* exec.c (init_exec_ops): make function not static.  We use it in
	the next nat code.
	* inftarg.c (init_child_ops): ditto

	* config/powerpc/macosx-mh: Move nextstep-nat-cfmthread.o to the
	to the CFM_FILES.
	
2000-08-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* values.c (value_change_enclosing_type): New function.
	* value.h: New function value_change_enclosing_type.
	* valops.c (value_cast): use the value_change_enclosing_type
	function rather than directly setting VALUE_ENCLOSING_TYPE.
	(value_assign): ditto.
	(value_assign): ditto.
	(value_addr): ditto.
	(value_ind): ditto.
	(value_ind): ditto.

	* buildsym.c (finish_block): Add the addresses to the Inner block
	outside outer block complaint even when we know the function name.
	No reason not to provide the info in this case, and it might be
	useful...
