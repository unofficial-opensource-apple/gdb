        * configure.in: Update powerpc-apple-darwin* target to include
	ia86, and to build gdb and binutils.

2002-10-07  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

        * install-sh: Revert to Cygnus version.

2002-09-12  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile.in: Remove a few extraneous diffs from FSF Makefile.in.

	* configure: Accidentally nuked Jason's check to set --build
	to $host_alias; restored it.
	
	* configure.in: Skip expect if $build != $host.  The previous
	test would skip expect whenever building for i386.

	* gdb/configure.in: By default, assume --with-mmalloc.  There
	is a file in gdb/macosx/ which requires mmalloc to compile.
	* gdb/acconfig.h: Updated.
	* gdb/Makefile.in: Remove electric-fence use.
	(YLWRAP): Reorder calls to ylwrap to conform to new usage.

	* tcl/unix/configure.in: Reorder gettimeofday() checks; maybe
	it's an autoconf bug, maybe it's an edge case, but this little
	hack works around it.

	* Makefile.in:  Remove electric-fence targets, dependencies.
	* configure.in: Remove electric-fence.
	Grab latest version of file from FSF.

	* configure: Grab latest version of file from FSF.
	* install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, ylwrap: Update from automake-1.6.

	* bfd/Makefile.am:  Drop electric-fence.
	* binutils/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* binutils/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* config/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* gas/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* gdb/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* ld/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* libiberty/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.

	* configure:  Fix it in a different place; revert previous
	change.

2002-08-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* configure: Set --build to $host_alias if we're not building
	Canadian cross; avoids a noisy warning from the autoconf-2.52
	generated configure files.

2001-09-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

       * configure:  Darwin's /bin/sh doesn't let you write to $PWD, so don't.
       Apple local change.
