	* lib/framework.exp: Use site_bug_id to store the bug-id for a
	site-specific bug, instead of overloading prms_id.  For now, assume
	that all site-specific bugs are specified by a Radar ID.

2002-11-08  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Mark tests for 3094426 - gdb
	future-break on selector doesn't work with hand-loaded shlib.

2002-11-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* runtest.exp: Rename --site-specific-xfail to --site-fail.
	Clean up the argument processing:  --site-fail is now the same
	as --site-fail=KFAIL; --site-fail= disables site-specific
	failure-handling support.

2002-11-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* runtest.exp: New variables, site_xfail and site_pass,
	control the default reporting values for triggered and un-triggered
	site_fails.  Remove entry for '--si' in the optarg list, it
	was not being hit before because of a missing '*' and shouldn't have
	been there anyway (we use --site= syntax).  Allow the user to
	specify 'site_xfail' with the '--site-specific-fail=' command-line
	argument.
	* lib/frameworks.exp: Convert to use site_xfail and site_pass.
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Lots of cleanup, reorganization.

2002-11-06  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* framework.exp (setup_site_xfail): Swap the order of the filename
	and the architecture in the setup_site_xfail arguments.
	(log_summary): Use 'info exists' instead of 'catch' to check for
	the existence of the key.
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Update site-fail list; remove obsolete entries.
	
2002-10-31  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * baseboards/macosx.exp: Update altivec test case names.

2002-10-28  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* aclocal.m4: Regenerate.
	* doc/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* example/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* testsuite/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* testsuite/libdejagnu/Makefile.in: Regenerate.

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework (fail): Fix syntax error in set array($key).

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework.exp (log_summary): Use $array($key) syntax instead
	of 'array get', to avoid unfortunate glob behavior for test names
	containing '['.
	(fail): Ditto.

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Site-specific kfail updates.

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework.exp (fail): Declare global pf_prefix, to avoid
	record_test using the last-set value of the global.  Store the
	file as well as the test name in the array key.  Generate a KFAIL
	instead of an XFAIL, to lessen confusion with the rest of the
	dejagnu output.
	(setup_site_xfail): Store the file as well as the test name in the
	array key.
	(log_summary): Generate KPASS instead of XPASS, to lessen
	confusion with the rest of the dejagnu output.

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework.exp (log_summary): Check for site_xfails
	before starting output, in case we weren't run with
	--site-specific-xfails (or in case none were defined).
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Update site-fail for printcmds.exp to
	use a1_0 instead of a1[0].

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Add i386 and gdb.apple/mi1-varobj.exp
	site-specific failures.

2002-10-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework.exp (unknown): Add new flag 'in_exit'; don't try
	to do log_and_exit, if unknown was called from within exit, as
	this leads to an infinite recursion.
	(log_summary): Add XPASS entries for all site-specific XFAILS for
	which the appropriate test file has been run, but which were not
	triggered by any FAILs in the test-run.
	(record_test): Store an array of 'seen' files, so we know which
	site-specific tests to generate XFAILs for.
	(setup_site_xfail): Store site_xfails as an array, not a list.
	Add a field to store the architectures for which the XFAIL is
	appropriate; also store a 'seen' flag to mark if the XFAIL has
	been triggered.
	(fail): Convert to use the new array.  Also check for the file and
	the target to match the ones specified by setup_site_xfail.  Mark
	the XFAIL as 'seen'.  Move the remote_close on timeout to the end
	of the function.
	
2002-10-17  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>
	
	* baseboards/rhapsody.exp: Remove.
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Remove obsolete setup_site_xfails.
	Fill in bug-id fields for many existing setup_site_xfails.

2002-10-16  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>
	
	* lib/remote.exp: Add new global do_site_xfail, defaulting to
	zero.  Match '--si' with do_site_xfail when processing arguments.
	* lib/framework.exp: Disable setup_site_xfail if do_site_xfail
	is not set.
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Add radar numbers for many
	setup_site_xfail entries; remove many obsolete entries.

2002-10-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>
	
	* lib/remote.exp (remote_expect): Add 0.1-second sleep to
	prevent random hangs.
	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Add setup_site_xfail commands for
	current failures.

2002-10-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* lib/framework.exp (setup_site_xfail): New command.
	(clone_output): Suppress output of XPASS messages to the terminal.

2002-09-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* lib/framework.exp (is_remote):  Add 'macosx' as a hardcoded native
	host type.

2002-09-19  Klee Dienes  (kdienes@apple.com)

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Update to use set_board_info() to set
	all variables.

2002-09-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Declare -gfull cmd line parameter in the
	correct place so tests that don't want debug info don't get it.

2002-09-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Pass -gfull to compiler to suppress some
	edge case failures.

2002-09-12  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Drop -DPROTOTYPES and -traditional-cpp, add
	-no-cpp-precomp.

2002-08-30  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* baseboards/macosx.exp: Add -DPROTOTYPES to the build flags. 

2001-09-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

       * runtest.exp:  Hackjob to change default target from "unix" 
        to "macosx".  An expedient, not correct, fix.  APPLE LOCAL.
